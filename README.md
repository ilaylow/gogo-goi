# Gogo-語彙

A new Flutter project created to play around with flutter and create a useful app for Kanji vocabulary for my own study.

## Existing Design

![Existing Design](https://github.com/ilaylow/gogo-goi/assets/45478832/3926b3d4-2fe4-4fea-aad7-89f404b0bf85)
(This diagram will be updated soon, as new features get updated)

## Next Few Ideas

- Notification system for prompting the user for a random kanji question every hour or so. ❌ (This is currently removed, but will be re-added at some point in time - it got more annoying than useful, will need to implement a toggle/setting feature for notification)
- Test interface for user to input フリガナ(furigana) reading of a Kanji. ✅
- Implement database so app can keep track of which words user has been tested on (and got wrong, basic stat tracking etc.) ✅ 
- Get home page to show different decks of uploaded cards, categorized by date inserted. ✅
- Show deck attempt history ✅
- Add basic word lookup feature ✅ 
- Allow for searching of deck by date input. (In progress)
- Allow for creation of deck locally on app and upload to cloud. (In progress)
- **(Advanced/Future)** Add in OCR recognition on image upload to detect words to be added to deck.
- **(Advanced/Future)** Add in draw feature so user can draw in kanji for search.
- **(Advanced/Future)** Expand app so it's accessible to other users, but may need an auth system for users to login. Is there a way to allow users to create their own decks in the cloud without needing an auth system? (One way is to generate some random key for each installation on a device, users should not be able to access this key, all decks created from this device are associated with this key, the user can request an email of the key to their preferred email, the key can then be used to pull the associated deck data on another device).
