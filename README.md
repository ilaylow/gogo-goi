# Gogo-語彙

A new Flutter project created to play around with flutter and create a useful app for Kanji vocabulary for my own study.

## Existing Design

## Next Few Ideas

- Notification system for prompting the user for a random kanji question every hour or so. ✅
- Test interface for user to input フリガナ(furigana) reading of a Kanji. ✅
- Implement database so app can keep track of which words user has been tested on (and got wrong, basic stat tracking etc.) ✅ (Kind of completed, but at the moment the app only interfaces with my own database)
