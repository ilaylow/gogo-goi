# Gogo-語彙

A new Flutter project created to play around with flutter and create a useful app for Kanji vocabulary.

## Next Few Ideas

- Notification system for a randomly selected word in the last selected user difficulty
- Test interface for user to input フリガナ(furigana) reading of a Kanji.
- Implement local database so app can keep track of which words user has been tested on (and got wrong, basic stat tracking etc.)
